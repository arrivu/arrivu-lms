# A couple of notes of discussion from the code review for when this inevitably
# gets used elsewhere:
#  * instance_method will raise an exception if the method doesn't exist; this
#    is _probably_ what you want.
#  * Manipulating after_save_callback_chain etc. may be more performant than
#    redefining methods. That doesn't matter for this use case.  Also, it
#    might not work with Rails 3 (which has built in support for this type
#    of thing), but this way definitely will
